## 📊 Key Results

| Experiment | Description | Observation |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Dimensional test** | 1-D → 2-D | Stable convergence but slower MSE decay |
| **Baseline TransNet** | Poisson & wave equations | Correct reproduction of paper results |
| **Hybrid-TransNet** | Skip-connected version | Lower MSE, faster ε-rank growth |
| **Nonlinear solver** | Burgers-type PDE | Stable convergence via Picard iteration |

## 🧮 Theoretical Context

This research is closely connected to  
- the **ε-rank and Staircase Phenomenon** (Yang et al., 2024), describing rank-loss correlation;  
- and **Least-Squares Neural Network (LSNN)** methods (Cai et al., 2022), which inspired the least-squares training formulation.

Together, they form a consistent theoretical foundation linking **network rank growth**, **residual decay**, and **PDE solution accuracy**.

## 🧠 Future Work

- Introduce **finite-volume or conservative operators** into TransNet (FV-TransNet).  
- Extend to **time-dependent and multi-physics PDEs**.  
- Analyze **rank dynamics** and convergence theoretically.  
- Explore **block-space-time training** similar to LSNN.
